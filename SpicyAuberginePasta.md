# Spicy Aubergine Pasta Sauce Recipe
This serves like 1-2 people? Every time I make this I eyeball all the measurements but for the sake of convenience I have added some (rough) guesses

Ingredients:

* Half an Aubergine or more, chopped into roughly bite sized chunks
* 2 - âˆž Garlic cloves, minced
* 1 Tin chopped tomato (could be replaced with lots of fresh tomatos chopped up)
* 1-1.5 tbsp of tomato puree  
* 1 small onion or half a big onion or 2/3's of a medium onion or 5/8's...... etc, diced
* Olive oil
* Salt & pepper (get a pepper grinder don't use pre ground come on)
* 0.5 - 1 tbsp Paprika Powder
* 0.25 - 1 tbsp Chilli Powder
* 0.25 - 1 tbsp Chilli flakes (i use both chilli powder and flakes but if you want less spice just pick one of the two)
* pinch (like half a tsp?) of sugar

Optional extras:
* Half a punnet of Mushroom, chopped
* 1 red/yellow pepper, chopped


## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 200 / fan 180 ish 
2. Put Aubergine on tray, lightly cover with the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and place in oven for between 25 and 35 minutes (until aubergine is nicely cooked, but not blackened/crisped)
3. Whilst aubergine is cooking, put enough oil in a pan that it mostly covers the bottom, and gently heat. When heated, add the paprika, chilli powder and chilli flakes and fry for like 2 mins? be very careful hear not to burn the spices 
4. After the 2 mins, add your onions and cook until translucent
5. Add garlic cloves and any bonus ingredients like mushroom/pepper and cook for a bit (2 - 5 mins?)
6. Add the tomato puree and tinned tomato, bring to a boil, and then simmer until the aubergine (and any bonus ingredients) is/are cooked (at least 5 mins)
7. Take aubergine from oven and mix into sauce

Voila! Should be nice! 

For an extra bit of good, mix in a little bit of the pasta water into the sauce - this helps it stick to the pasta better and adds some nice salt (assuming you have salted your pasta water which you should be doing)
